ext. somewhere


Dave, James, Kiko and Dirk notice the temperature drop, before stopping playing their instruments with a shiver.

Dave and James glance at each other worriedly/knowingly, then turn their heads to look up and behind them.

[[ CUT TO WHERE DAVE AND JAMES ARE LOOKING ]]

Vic Rattlehead is descending from the sky with a staff in his hand.


VIC RATTLEHEAD
Well well well well well! If it ain’t my favourite punching bags!


Vic tilts his head to the side and puts his finger to his chin in a pseudo-cutesy fashion with a giggle.


VIC R.
We have...
Davey...

CUT TO: DAVE

Dave is looking up (not directly at the camera) with an apprehensive expression.

[[CAMERA TRUCKS QUICKLY TO JAMES (RIGHT)]]

VIC R.
Lomenzo...


David frowns and clenches his hands into fists with a growl.

[[CAMERA TRUCKS QUICKLY TO KIKO (RIGHT)]]

VIC R.
Kiko...

[[CAMERA TRUCKS QUICKLY TO DIRK (RIGHT)]]

VIC R.
And... oh-! Looks like we got a new addition to the menagerie!


DIRK
(yelling)
My name is *Dirk* — 

Dirk stomps his foot, creating a resounding boom.

DIRK
(cont.)
— you fucker!


Vic is thrown off for a couple seconds. He regains his balance.


VIC R.
Oh dear, throwing a little tantrum, are we? 

Vic laughs.

VIC R.
You know... I don’t take too kindly to *brats*.


Vic’s eyes begin glowing green through his visor.

Vic raises his hand. Pointy little bones materialize. Moving his raised hand forward, he sends the bones hurtling towards the four bandmates.

[[CAMERA FOLLOWS THE BONES AND TURNS TO DAVE AND CO.]]

James quickly raises his hand up. A block of ice shoots up from the ground. The bones collide with it and clatter uselessly to the floor.
