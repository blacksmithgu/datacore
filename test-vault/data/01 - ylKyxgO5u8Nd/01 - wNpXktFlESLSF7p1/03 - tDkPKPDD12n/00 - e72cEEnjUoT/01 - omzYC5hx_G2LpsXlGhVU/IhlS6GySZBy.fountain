Dirk, water chains!

DIRK
Right!

Dirk raises his arm. Seconds later, the ground breaks to make way for a jet of water (from a water main). The water morphs into solid-looking chains. Dirk, sweating a little from exertion, sends the chains hurling towards Vic.

[[camera rotates around the chains..]]

One water chain wraps around Vic’s right arm.

VIC
Huh-?!

Another water chain wraps around Vic’s left arm.
