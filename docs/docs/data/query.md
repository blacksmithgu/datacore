Datacore comes with a query language which can be used to filter down the set of result objects. Queries
produce sets of results - sections, blocks, pages, etc. They can be combined with `and` and `or`.

## Using Queries

You'll usually be using queries with the datacore `query` and `useQuery` functions:

```js
// Inside of a react component, watch the results of a query live. Automatically updates
// whenever the query results change.
const pages = dc.useQuery("@page");

// In a plugin context or in more advanced usage, you can run a query a single time with `query`.
const pages = dc.query("@page and rating > 9");
```

## Basic Query Types

### `@type`

You can fetch all objects of a specific type (section, page, etc) using a `@type` query. To fetch
all pages, use `@page`; to fetch all blocks, use `@block`. The full set of currently supported types
is below:

- `@file`: All files.
- `@page`: All markdown pages.
- `@section`: All markdown sections in markdown pages.
- `@block`: All markdown blocks in markdown pages.
- `@block-list`: All markdown blocks that contain lists in them.
- `@codeblock`: All markdown codeblocks.
- `@datablock`: All datacore 'datablocks', which are special codeblocks annotated with `yaml:data`.
- `@list-item`: All list items in markdown pages.
- `@task`: All task items (of the form `- [ ]`).

Type queries are usually combined with other queries to filter to specific types - for example,
`@section and #tag` will return sections tagged with `#tag`.

### `#tag`

You can fetch all objects tagged with a given tag using `#tag` - for example, `#game` or `#philosophy/natural`. 

### `connected()`

You can fetch objects that link TO or link FROM a given page. To find all pages that link TO a document,
use `linkedto([[link]])`; to find pages that link FROM a document, use `linkedfrom([[link]])`. If you
want all links regardless of direction, just use `connected([[link]])`.

### `path()`

You can fetch all objects at the given path/folder in your vault using `path("path/to/folder")`. To
fetch all files in your `Games` folder, for example, use `path("Games")`.

### `exists()`

You can fetch all objects which have a specific metadata field defined with `exists`. For example,
`exists(rating)` will return all pages which have `rating` defined.

### `parentof()`

Datacore supports searching for the *parents* of certain objects - for example, if you want to find
all pages that contain json codeblocks. This is implemented via `parentof()`, which takes a query that
matches objects and instead matches all parents of those objects. For example, if `#pizza` would match a collection of blocks and sections, `parentof(#pizza)` would match the sections and pages that contain those blocks/sections.

`parentof()` is best described via examples:

```js
// Find all pages that contain datacore codeblocks.
@page and parentof(@codeblock and $languages.contains("datacorejs"))

// Find pages which have `Daily` sections.
@page and parentof(@section and $name = "Daily")
```

By default, `parentof()` is exclusive, meaning it will only return the parents of the input query; if
you want to also return the matches of the input query, use `supertree()`:

```js
// Return all of the parent sections/pages of codeblocks.
parentof(@codeblock)
// Return the parent sections and pages of codeblocks, and the codeblocks themselves.
supertree(@codeblock)
```

### `childof()`

The complementary operation to `parentof()`; given an input query, produces all of the children of
the matching objects. `@page` produces all pages; `childof(@page)` produces all sections, blocks, list items, and so on.

Like `parentof()`, `childof()` is exclusive by default and will not return matches from the input query.
If you want to also get matches from the input query, use `subtree()`.

```js
// Return all sections, blocks, etc that are children of markdown pages.
childof(@page)
// Return page objects and all of the sections, blocks, etc in them.
subtree(@page)
```

### Expressions

You can execute arbitrary [expressions](../expressions/index.md) in a search; the expression will be checked against each object in the datacore index to find matches. For example,

```js
// Find all objects with a rating field that is 9 or greater.
rating >= 9

// Find all sections which have a name NOT equal to 'Daily'.
@section and $name != "Daily"

// Find all sections whose name contains `Daily`.
@section and $name.contains("Daily")
```

## Query Combinators

You can combine queries with the standard suite of operations.

### `and`

You can combine two queries with `and`: `@block and #book` matches all `@blocks` tagged `#book`. Queries
combined with `and` only return results that match both subqueries.

### `or`

Queries combined with `or` match objects that match either or both of the subqueries: `@block or #book`
matches all `@blocks`, all objects tagged `#block`, and blocks tagged `#book`.

### `!not`

You can negate a query with `!`: negated queries match everything that the original query does not match. So `!#book` matches every object that is NOT tagged `#book`.

Negated queries can be slow since they can produce an enormous number of results - to keep performance
up, make sure to keep your query specific - for example, instead of `!#book`, use `!#book and @block`.

```
@task and $completed = false and childof(@section and $name = "Daily")
```
</CodeExample>
